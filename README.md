# O-Arcade
 
The purpose of this site is to be able to play all of the games one enjoys and loves at the arcade in one place. 

As the site is still in the production stage, with the current games currently present, one can compete with their friends and have all of the data saved even when closing the application. The games which are currently playable are:
- Guess the Number: With the number being 1 to 100, the user has to guess the number with hotter or colder accommodations.
- Number Memorization: The user will need to memorize a number in increasing number of digits after every round where the user will begin by memorizing the 1-digit number, then 2-digit, and so on. 
- Slots: The user will test out their luck, and see how many spins it takes the user to get all three slots the same number.

How to Run the Server:
- When the files are downloaded, open your computer's terminal, and direct your terminal to the folder with those said files. To run the server type into the terminal
```bash 
node CBproject-server.js
```
- Doing so will allow you to run the site's server, and you can begin saving the data without having to keep your site open.
- To begin playing, simply open the HTML file, and enjoy.
